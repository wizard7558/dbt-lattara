  PRIMARY CONVERSION METRICS (use these by default):
  - optimization_conversions: The primary conversion event each account optimizes toward
  - cost_per_optimization_conversion: Cost per primary conversion (spend / optimization_conversions)

  Use optimization_conversions and cost_per_optimization_conversion for all conversion 
  analysis unless the user specifically asks for "all conversions" or "total conversions".

  TRAFFIC METRICS:
  - total_spend: Total advertising spend in USD
  - total_impressions: Number of times ads were shown
  - total_clicks: Number of clicks on ads
  - ctr: Click-through rate (clicks / impressions)
  - cpc: Cost per click (spend / clicks)
  - cpm: Cost per thousand impressions

  SECONDARY CONVERSION METRICS (only when specifically requested):
  - total_conversions: All conversion events (includes non-optimization events)
  - total_conversion_value: Revenue from conversions
  - cpa: Cost per acquisition (all conversions)
  - roas: Return on ad spend

  Data hierarchy: Account > Campaign > Conversion Action

  Filter by is_optimization_conversion = true to see only primary conversion events.
